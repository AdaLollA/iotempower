Syntax: deploy [<node-address> [key]
               |compile
               |adopt <uiot-node-id-nL-mS>
               |[adopt] serial [port] [force]
               ]

deploy must be called from a node directory (or one of its parent system
directories) and reads its configuration from there.

It rebuilds firmwares for the affected nodes and remotely flashes
the respected nodes.

If a node-address is given (for example as an IP), deploy will flash the 
node with that respective address remotely. If also a password is given, then
this password is used instead of the specific node password. This can be
important to re-initialize a node configured for a different system.

If compile is specified, deploy only tries to compile the respective node
firmware. 

If adopt serial is specified, a locally (via serial) connected node will
be flashed. With port the serial port can optionally be specified. It will
overwrite (re-flash) all settings and initial parameters of the locally
connected node. Without specifying force

If adopt is given with a network in of the form uiot-node-id-nL-mS, 
a single node on the network that is in configuration mode
will be overwritten with the current configuration and adopted as a new node
in the current network.
For this adoption process, it is using a locally connected ulnoiot esp dongle.
It will not work if no dongle is locally connected.
The respective board has to be in configuration/adopt mode (this mode
is usually triggerd via pressing and releasing the flash key twice during
its five second power-up phase).

If deploy is called from a node's parent folder, it deploys all nodes in
subdirectories of this parent folder.

If key is given, it overrides the deduced flash-key.

port: can be empty to search for connected device, usb0, usb1, or acm0, acm1, ...
