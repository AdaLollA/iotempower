Syntax: initialize [serial [port]|ip-address [key]|[adopt]]

initialize must be called from a node directory and reads its configuration
from there.
If called without any parameter or a specific serial port, it looks for a 
locally (i.e. via serial or the respective port) connected board and overwrites
it (re-flashes), setting all initial parameters.

It flashes the node with the ulnoiot firmware. It then sets or overwrites 
wifi and  encryption data, respective to the current node configuration folder.
If adopt or nothing is specified, it does the intialization via network.
The respective board has to be in configuration mode and connected to the same
wifi as ulnoiot currently runs in for this to work.

If key is given it overrides the deduced flash-key.

port: can be empty, usb0, usb1, or acm0, acm1, ...
