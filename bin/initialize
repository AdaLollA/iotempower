Syntax: initialize [serial_port] [wemosd1pro] [noflash]

initialize must be called from a node directory and reads its configuration
from there.
It looks for a locally (i.e. via serial) connected board matching the node
description.

It flashes the board with ulnoiot's version of micropython (if noflash is given,
this step is skipped).
It then sets or overwrites wifi and encryption data, respective to the current
node configuration folder.
Then, it calls a local/serial update on it and installs initial system
user-space software.
Then it calls a network deploy to copy the user folder and autostart to it.
The last two steps fail, if the node router and mqtt broker are not available.
Running deploy noupdate again (when router and mqtt broker become avaialable)
fixes/finishes this.

If the option wemosd1pro is given, the flash size is fixed to 4MB (even if the
wemos d1 mini pro has 16MB as the flasher does not support 16MB).

serial_port: can be usb0, usb1, or acm0, acm1, ...
