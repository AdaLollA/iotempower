Syntax: update_serial [serial_port] [alsodeploy]

update_serial must be called from a node directory and reads its configuration
from there.
It looks for a locally (i.e. via serial) connected board matching the node
description.

It performs a local (serial) update and installs initial system
user-space software.
If alsodeploy is set it also copies the user folder and autostart to it.

serial_port: can be empty, usb0, usb1, or acm0, acm1, ...
