rgb_multi(name, data_pin, num_leds, ignore_case=True)

Create a new rgb strip device object for an rgb-led stri connected to the given
data_pin with num_leds rgb leds. The supported chip is the ws2812b (used for
example in neopixel led strips).
Name will be appended to the mqtt topic.
Under the resulting topic will be the following subtopics:
- set: turn on or off
- brightnes/status, brightness/set: read and set brightness (0-255)
- rgb/status, rgb/set: read and set color as colorname, 6-digit hexcode (rrggbb)
                       or comma separated triplet (r,g,b)
                       This also takes a number to just affect one led
- animation: check help("animation" to see how this works)

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- data_pin: the data-pin the led strip is connected to
- num_led: number of leds on strip
- ignore_case: should case in the command detection be ignored

Example:
mqtt("192.168.12.1","living room/tvlights")
rgb_multi("rgb2",d2,10)

Now the second RGB LED can be switched to red via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "living room/tvlights/rgb2/rgb/set" the command "2 red"
