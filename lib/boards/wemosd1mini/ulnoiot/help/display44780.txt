display44780( name, sda, scl,
              width=16, height=2,
              addr=0x3c, ignore_case=False):

Create a new controller for an i2c 1602 or 44780 based lcd display.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and a set appended to
send text and commands to.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- sda: the gpiopin for sda
- scl: the gpiopin for scl
- width/height: dimensions of display in characters
- addr: the i2c address of display, this is usually either 0x3c or 0x3d
  (on the display it says 0x7a or 0x78 respectively)
- ignore_case: should case in the command detection be ignored

Example:
display44780("dp1",d3,d4)

Now the display can be controlled via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "node_topic/dp1/set" different text or commands.
Normal text will be printed as text - scrolling is supported.
There are also these special commands:
&&clear                       to clear the display
&&plot x1 y1 x2 y2 ...        to draw a list of pixels
