i2c_connector( name, sda, scl, addr=8):

Create a new controller for an Arduino connected as i2c slave to the given
i2c bus.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic to report i2c output of the Arduino
and a set appended to send messages as input to the Arduino.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- sda: the gpiopin for sda
- scl: the gpiopin for scl
- addr: the i2c address (8 by default)

Example:
i2c_connector("scale1",d3,d4)

Now the commands can be sent to the connected Arduino via the topic
"node_topic/scale1/set". On "node_topic/scale1" output of the Arduino will
be received.

For the Arduino code compare:
ulnoiot/lib/arduino_i2c_connector/connector/connector.ino and extend it for
your own project.
