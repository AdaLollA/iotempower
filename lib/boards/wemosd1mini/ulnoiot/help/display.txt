name will be appended to the mqtt topic and a set appended to
send text and commands to.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- sda: the gpiopin for sda
- scl: the gpiopin for scl
- ignore_case: should case in the command detection be ignored

&&plot x1 y1 x2 y2 ...        to draw a list of pixels
