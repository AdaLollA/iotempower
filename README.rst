ulnoiot / IoT Empower
=====================

*ulnoiot* (pronounced: "You'll know IoT", we are currently re-branding
ulnoiot as *IoT Empower* part of our IoT Empire community approach) is a
framework and environment
for making it easy for everyone to explore and develop for the
Internet of Things (IoT)
-- easy for tinkerers, makers, programmers, hobbyists, students, artists,
and professionals alike.
It has a special focus on education and is intended to support classes to teach
Internet of Things (IoT) and
home automation.

However, it also supports existing IoT deployments and brings
mechanisms for over the air (OTA) updates and automatic
multi-device deployment.
