servo_switch("name", pin, 
  on_angle, off_angle, return_angle,
  on_command="on", off_command="off",
  turn_time_ms=700,
  min_us=600, max_us=2400);

Create a new servo motor controller acting as a switch.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and a set appended to
send commands to.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- pin: the gpiopin
- on_angle/off_angle: respective angles for on/off postions
- return_angle: a medium angle to return to after pushing to on/off position
    (if not given as parameter, this feature is not used and motor does not
    return here)
- on_command/off_command: what needs to be sent to turn the motor to on/off
    position
- turn_time_ms: how long to give the motor in ms to reach its position before
                stopping power
- min_us, max_us: values controlling the motor settings

Example:
servo_switch("m1", D4, 0, 180, 90);

Now the motor can be controlled via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "node_topic/m1/set" the command on or off
