  on_command='on', off_command='off',
  back_to_angle=None,

Create a new stepper motor controller acting as a switch.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and a set appended to
send commands to.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- pin: the gpiopin
- on_angle/off_angle: respective angles for on/off postions
- on_command/off_command: what needs to be sent to turn the motor to on/off
                          position
- back_to_angle: a medium angle to return to after pushing to on/off position
- turn_time_ms: how long to give the motor in ms to reach its position before
-               stopping power
- freq, min_us, max_us: values controlling the motor settings
- angle: reach of the stepper motor
- ignore_case: should case in the command detection be ignored

Example:
servo_switch("m1",d4,0,179,back_to_angle=90)

Now the motor can be controlled via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "node_topic/m1/set" the command on or off
