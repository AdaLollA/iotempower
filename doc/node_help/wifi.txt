To reconfigure wifi of a previously used ulnoiot node
(if the node never has been flashed with ulnoiot before, use initialize to
flash it), make sure you have a flash button connected (usually D3 or pin 0 
against ground). Reset (or power off and on the device), wait until it starts 
blinking and press the flash button 2 or three times during this first blinking
five seconds.

Then, the node is in reconfiguration mode, and starts as its own wifi
accesspoint. It will show up in the list of WiFi networks called something like
ulnoiot-abcdef (the last 6 characters vary). The onboard led will blink in some
kind of Morse code (several long blinks and several short blinks). Count the
blinks - you can use them to verify your node in the configuration portal
later.

Use a phone or tablet (a computer works too) to connect to the wifi.
The default wifi-password in reconfiguration mode is iotempire.
Modern phones will directly go to the configuration page or ask you to sign in
and then go tho the configuration page. If this is not the case try to manually
access the coniguration page on http://192.168.4.1

Connect your node to your local WiFi or the ulnoiot raspberry pi WiFi (often
called iotempire-something, also password iotempire) and remember the
hex-code of the device (write it down). Also verify the blink frequency.

After you saved the configuration, you can navigate to your node-directory and
call: 
initialize remembered-hexcode-id
This sends all security cerdentials and configuration values to your node.

For later updates, you just need to call deploy from your node directory.
