hcsr04(internal_name, "external_name", 
    trigger_pin, echo_pin, timeout_us=30000);

Create a new HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measuring device.
It reads the distance in mm.

Parameters:
- internal_name: name of variable to create to address this device inside
  this file by other devices or helper functions.
- external_name: the name it can be addressed via MQTT in the network.
- trigger_pin: where the trigger pin is connected to
- echo_pin: where the echo pin is connected to
- timeout_us: how long to max wait for a return signal (usually no need to 
  change default)
- .with_precision(precision): can be used to only react for changes in
  measuring that are bigger or equal to this value

WARNING:
This device usually needs 5V input voltage. To read the Echo Pin with a 3.3V
device like the esp8266 or a Raspberry Pi zero, you must use a level shifter 
or setup a voltage divider for the echo-pin (for example echo pin via 1kOhm to 
the GPIO-Echo-Input and 2kOhm to ground).

Example:
hcsr04(dist, "distance", D2, D1).with_precision(precision=10);
