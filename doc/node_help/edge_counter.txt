edge_counter( "name", pin, rising=true, falling=true );

Create a new input port for an edge_counter,
measuring either a falling or rising edge on the
respective input port.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and
a trigger count will be published there.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- pin: the gpio pin
- rising: if true, count rising edges
- falling: if true, count falling edges
- .with_pullup(false) can be used to disable internal pullup (default enabled)

edge_counter("left", D3)

Now, the number of rising and falling edges is published as 
"living room/shock1/left"
