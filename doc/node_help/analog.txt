d("analog", name, precision=1, threshold=None)

Create a new analog sensor. By default it reports all value changes.
An analog value is between 0 an 1023. If precision is>1, report only changes
with a delta of at least precision.
Setting threshold to a value from 0 to 1023 triggers sending a 1, when the
sensor reads this threshold value or a higher value, and 0 when reading a lower
value.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- precision: report only changes with at least this delta
- threshold: turn into digital sensor, sending 1 when threshold is reached
  and 0 if not.

Example:
nodename: basement/water-sensor01
d("analog", "water", threshold=100, precision=10)

Now, a value of 1 is sent to "basement/water-sensor01/water", when the analog
port reads a value of more than 90 (threshold - precision). It will start
sending 0 again, when it reads a value<=90, this could though be 80 due to only
updating values, when changed by amount of precision.
