rgb_single(name, pin_r, pin_g, pin_b);

Create a new rgb device object for an rgb-led connected to the pins
pin_r (red pin), pin_g (green pin), and pin_b (blue pin).
Name will be appended to the mqtt topic.
Under the resulting topic will be the following subtopics:
- set: turn on or off
- brightness/status, brightness/set: read and set brightness (0-255)
- rgb/status, rgb/set: read and set color as colorname, 6-digit hexcode (rrggbb)
                       or comma separated triplet (r,g,b)

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed via MQTT in the network. Inside the code
  it can be addressed via IN(name).
- pin_r, pin_g, pin_b: the gpiopin for red, green, and blue lines
- ignore_case: should case in the command detection be ignored

Example (node name: living room/tvlights):
rgb_single(rgb1, D3, D4, D2)


Now the RGB LED can be switched to red via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "living room/tvlights/rgb1/rgb/set" the command red
