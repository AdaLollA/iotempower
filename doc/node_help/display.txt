display( name, sda, scl,
         width=128, height=64,
         addr=0x3c):

Create a new controller for an i2c 128x64 ssd1306 lcd display.
name will be appended to the mqtt topic and a set appended to
send text and commands to.

Parameters:
- name: the name it can be addressed under
- sda: the gpiopin for sda
- scl: the gpiopin for scl
- width/height: dimensions of display in pixels
- addr: the i2c address of display, this is usually either 0x3c or 0x3d
  (on the display it says 0x7a or 0x78 respectively)

Example:
display("dp1",d4,d3)

Now the display can be controlled via sending to the mqtt-broker
to the topic "node_topic/dp1/set" different text or commands.
Normal text will be printed as text - scrolling is supported.
There are also these special commands:
&&clear                       to clear the display
&&plot x1 y1 x2 y2 ...        to draw a list of pixels
&&cursor x y                  to set the text cursor
&&newline, &&linefeed, &&nl, or &&lf
                              to go to next line and evtl. scroll display
