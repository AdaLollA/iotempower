deep_sleep(time_from_now_ms, duration_ms);

Fall in time_from_now_ms ms into deep_sleep mode for duration_ms ms.
Remember to wire RST to D0 (or internal pin nr 16).
deep_sleep has to be specified in the start method.

Careful: any status of an actor is forgotten.

example:
void start() {
    // here can be something like device intialization or the transmission call
    deep_sleep(10000, 30000);
    // other device initializations
}

This makes the node fall asleep in 10s and wake then up in another 30s.
