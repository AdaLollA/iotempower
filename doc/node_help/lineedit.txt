lineedit(filename,linenr,insert=False)

Edit one line (the one in linenr) in a text file. If linenr is one line after
last line, add the line to the file. If insert is set to True, insert the line
before the specified line. Use linecat(filename) to list file contents of
filename with prefixed line numbers.

>>> cp("/user.py.example","usertest.py")
>>> lineedit("/usertest.py",7)
