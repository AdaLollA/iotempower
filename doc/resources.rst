External Resources
------------------

This project would not have been possible without a thriving open source
community around the Internet of Things. We make a lot of use of the following
tools:

- `PlatformIO <http://platform.io>`__
- `node-red <https://nodered.org>`__
- `mosquitto <https://mosquitto.org/>`__.
- `The Tilde Texteditor <https://os.ghalkes.nl/tilde>`__
- `create_ap <https://github.com/oblique/create_ap>`__ forked for ulnoiot
  `here <https://github.com/ulno/create_ap>`__.
- `FastLed rgb-strip library <https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED>`__
- `rpi-clone <https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone>`__
- `cloudcmd <https://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd>`__

Old versions were also using these:

- `mpfshell <https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell>`__ forked for ulnoiot
  `here <https://github.com/ulno/mpfshell>`__.
- `micropython  <https://micropython.org/>`__


As ulnoiot relies heavily on MQTT, it also integrates very easily with
other community home automation software like
`home-assistant <http://home-assistant.io>`__ and
`openhab <https://openhab.org>`__.
