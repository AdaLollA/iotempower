Use the Escape key (ESC) to close this help. Use ctrl-a h to open this help
again.

You can scroll through this help with the cursor keys as well as using the scroll wheel on your mouse or scroll gesture on your touchpad. If you want to
search, use ctrl-f (enter search word and later use n or p for next or
previous).

The terminal here is not a totally normal terminal, it is a terminal
multiplexer based on tmux (http://github.com/tmux/tmux). Why do you want this
in ulnoiot, you ask? This allows you to reconnect to your terminal session,
even if you got disconnected.

However, tmux allows you to other very helpful things with your terminal
session which are described here briefly:


- ctrl-a ctrl-Space or ctrl-a Space: Enter tmux copy-mode
  This allows you to select 
- ctrl-a Right-cursor: select next window to right (next)
- ctrl-a Left-cursor: select next window to left (previous)

## commands to help in bash
- ctrl-x ctrl-e : edit current command line in editor
